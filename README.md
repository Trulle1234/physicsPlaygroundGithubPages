# physicsPlayground

An **interactive 2D physics playground** built with **Matter.js**, where you can experiment with bodies and even control gravity with your device’s tilt!

> **Note:** To use device-tilt controls on phones you **must** serve over HTTPS (see below).

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive:** Interact with the bodies using your mouse.
- **Drag & Drop:** Tweek the settings and drop in bodies from the menu.
- **Device Tilt:** On supported mobile browsers, tilt your phone to change gravity direction.  
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:**  
  - **C** – Clear the scene  
---

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- **Node.js** & **npm** (v14+)
- **Matter.js**  
  ```bash
  npm install matter-js
  ```

Modern browsers restrict access to device‑motion APIs on non‑secure origins. You’ll need a self‑signed SSL cert for local testing.
